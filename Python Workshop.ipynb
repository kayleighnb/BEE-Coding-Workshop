    "### Goals for today\n",
    "This session is intended to guide you through the practical implementation of basic analytic techniques in Python in Jupyter notebooks. Python is an open-source statistical computing software used to analyze data (among many, many other things). A Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. This workshop will be focused on interactive demonstration in Python, but also include time for additional questions and guidance in working through the sample code. We will cover some fundamental coding techniques that will help you in Econ 140, basic data science classes, or research assistant positions. This workshop is for *beginners* that have little or no coding experience.\n",

    "- One attendee from today's workshop will be randomly selected to win a 20 dollar gift card to Amazon \n",
    "- Attendance to this workshop comes with free access to datacamp through July. Datacamp offers online courses in both R and Python so that you can continue learning after today's workshop \n",
    "- Link to join Berkeley Econ's datacamp group with @berkeley.edu ID: [here](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/9cecd27b5daab26dc69f7d4a48b3c2ae5e20ff9ed77e3e239fa2e4510a4848d3) (make sure you're signed out of datacamp before clicking this - otherwise the sign-up gets screwed and you'll be asked to pay after the first chapter of any course)\n",

    "- To create a new notebook, click the \"New\" button and select Python 3\n",
    "- Write Python script by selecting the option \"Code\" from the dropdown list, or write text by selecting \"Markdown\"\n",
    "- Select \"Insert\" to add a block of text or code\n",
    "- Run code by highlighting and selecting \"Run\"\n",
    "- Use the # symbol to add comments to the script, or to add headlines to text selections\n",
